# PMM

This project is about PMM and PSMM as two differentially private synthetic data algorithms. More details of the algorithm can be found at https://proceedings.mlr.press/v195/he23a.html.

In this project, PMM.py provides a simple simulation for generating differentially private synthetic data in $[0,1]^d$.
